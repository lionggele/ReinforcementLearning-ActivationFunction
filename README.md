# Task 2 Directory README

Welcome to the Task 2 directory! This directory is part of the AdaAF (Adaptive Activation Function) project, which explores various activation functions in deep learning models. Below is a structured outline of the directory with descriptions for each component.

## Directory Structure Overview

### AdaAF
- **Ada_learnableAF**
  - `graph`: Contains graphs related to Adaptive activation functions.
  - `DQN_PRELU-ELU.py`: Implements DQN with PReLU and ELU activation functions.

### Gated_Activation
- `graph`: Contains graphs related to Gated activation functions.
  - `Ada_Gated.py`: Implements Ada gated activation functions.


### Hirachical Structure
- `graph`: Contains graphs related to Hierarchical activation functions.
  - `DQN-AdaAFOAF-All.py`: Implements DQN with AdaAFOAF for all conditions.
  - `myplotgraphbefore.png`: Pre-run plot for the hierarchical structure.


### AF and OAF
#### AF
